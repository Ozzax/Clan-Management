# Clan-Management
A free-to-use and editable repository for general management and specifically for clan games

🏆 Clan Management System
A console-based program that allows users to create and manage clans, inspired by the game "MTA". This project was motivated by my passion for gaming and my goal of improving my programming skills through practical projects.

🎯 What Does This Program Do?
1️⃣ Asks the user if they want to create a clan.
2️⃣ Prompts for the number of clans to create.
3️⃣ Collects detailed information about each clan.
4️⃣ Asks for the number of members and assigns them roles.
5️⃣ Gathers all the data and prints the final clan information.

🔥 Planned Features (Coming ASAP)
✅ Clan Competitions – Allow clans to compete against each other.
✅ Round Counter – Track rounds for each competition.
✅ Winner & Loser System – Determine which clan wins or loses.

💡 About the Development
I built almost 90% of this program by myself, with ChatGPT assisting in around 10% of the tasks. This project has helped me improve my C++ skills, and I hope you enjoy testing it!
